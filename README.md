# ML Classification Case Studies

This repository contains applied machine learning projects that go beyond basic tutorials.  
Each case study focuses on realistic challenges in classification such as:

- Handling imbalanced datasets with resampling and class weighting  
- Performing hyperparameter tuning*with cross-validation  
- Applying feature selection and stability analysis  
- Evaluating models with clinically and practically meaningful metrics  

The repo currently includes:

- **Imbalanced Appendicitis Diagnosis**: exploring medical data imbalance using kNN and Decision Trees  
- **Student Performance Prediction**: comparing Logistic Regression and Decision Trees with feature selection  

These projects showcase practical ML workflows that emphasise evaluation, interpretability and reproducibility.
